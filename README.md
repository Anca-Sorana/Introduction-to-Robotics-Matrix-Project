# Introduction to Robotics: Matrix Project
## Mini 8x8 LED Matrix Game

### Project Overview

In this game, players use an LCD for navigating the menu and viewing key game details. The joystick serves dual purposes: menu navigation and in-game control. The objective is to strategically place bombs to break walls, with the challenge of not getting caught in the blast. Breaking multiple walls simultaneously boosts the score more rapidly. Losing all lives results in game over, redirecting the player to the main menu. The menu includes options for adjusting the brightness of both the LCD and the LED matrix, and toggling sound settings, allowing for a personalized gaming experience. The menu also displays details about the game's creator and how to play the game.
